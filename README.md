# Motion Planning for 6 DoF Robotic Manipulator

The repository contains the ROS packages to control the motors of the manipulator, and perform motion planning using MoveIt.

It also contains the URDF of the manipulator along with the Arduino Files used to communicate between the host machine (PC) and the Arduino which was attached to the manipulator.

This repository was part of a project for the ME380 mechanical design project at University of Waterloo.
